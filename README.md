🧩 DataWeave

AI-Assisted Data Integration Platform
Seamlessly merge, clean, and validate complex datasets — with transparency, control, and intelligence.

🚀 Inspiration

DataWeave was born out of a frustration that every data engineer, analyst, or consultant has faced — dealing with messy, inconsistent, and disconnected data sources.

While companies invest heavily in ETL tools and warehouses, the human-in-the-loop experience — where analysts can see, understand, and guide AI-driven transformations — is often missing.
We wanted to build something that feels as intuitive as Notion or PowerApps, powered by Gemini + OpenAI intelligence, with Supabase and cloud storage flexibility.

💡 What It Does

DataWeave is an AI-assisted data integration platform that helps organizations merge, clean, and validate messy datasets — without losing control or transparency.

📁 Upload: Users upload folders containing Excel/CSV files and schema definitions.

🧠 Infer Relationships: DataWeave automatically identifies table relationships (primary/foreign keys) and generates schema visualizations.

🔄 AI-Assisted Mapping: It then maps two different databases or schemas, even when structures differ.

👩‍💻 Human Control: Users can validate, adjust, and approve AI mappings and transformations.

📊 Output: Produces clean, unified CSVs/Excels and a new schema file describing the merged data model.

🛠️ How We Built It

Frontend:

Built with Next.js (React + TailwindCSS + MUI)
Intuitive drag-and-drop uploads, schema visualizer (React Flow), and column mapping interface inspired by PowerApps

Backend:

FastAPI + Pandas for dataset parsing, normalization, and merge operations

AI Layer:

Gemini API (LLM) for semantic schema understanding, column mapping, and data relationship inference

Output:

Merged structured datasets and a new schema definition describing inferred relationships and mappings

⚙️ Workflow Overview

Upload two databases (source & target) > 
Backend reads and summarizes schema & table metadata > 
LLM infers relationships between tables within each dataset > 
LLM performs cross-database mapping (source → target) > 
User reviews & edits mappings via intuitive UI > 
System merges and exports clean unified CSVs/Excels >
